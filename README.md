ðŸ›’ E-Commerce App with Redux Toolkit

This application demonstrates how to manage global state efficiently using Redux Toolkit in a React-based project. It showcases a simple e-commerce platform where users can:
- Browse a list of products
- Add products to a shopping cart
- View and remove items from the cart

The main focus of this app is to show how Redux Toolkit allows you to share state across all components â€” without relying on component hierarchy â€” making data like cart contents globally accessible throughout the application.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
